                        <p>I work with folks from up and down the lifespan, servicing virtually between TX and LA, and in person in the DFW area. I enjoying with youth and their families, who tend to be neurodiverse. I believe counseling rapport is one of the greatest facilitated in inner motivation for change. Following a strong foundation of trust is established, I like to incorporate "skills scaffolding" including goals of somatic "CAAR" skills for regulation and urge interruption. Following, I like to explore emotions, values, beliefs with a client in tandem with skills scaffolding. For the processing of "bigger" emotions, I believe in using art, time in nature, time with animals, and movement. My practice remains rooted in inclusivity and being able to offer help to people from all different backgrounds and identities.

                     <p>Jess Maxwell grew up in little Forest Hills of the DFW. Jess attended Booker T Washington where she had a focus on ceramics, a passion she continues to enjoy to this day.</p>
                <p> In 2005, Jess moved to New Orleans LA to obtain her bachelor’s in psychology which is where she first began working with kiddos on the autistic spectrum.</p>
                <p> Following graduating from Loyola in 2009, Jess became more focused on her own psychological well-being and started studying Kripalu Yoga. Jess received her Kripalu teaching training certificate in 2010 and began teaching in the New Orleans area shortly after.</p>
                <p> In 2012, Jess decided that she wanted to attend Graduate School to pursue research on using yoga in forms of rehabilitation and graduated from LSU with a master’s in health science and a focus in clinical rehabilitation and counseling in 2015.</p>
                <p> Jess started working in inpatient care shortly after school, in long term as well as acute inpatient care. Jess has worked on a assertive community treatment team, as well as within the school system.</p>
                <p> In 2020 in the wake of the pandemic just decided to specialize more in eating disorders as adjacent to the trauma work that she was doing in private practice. Jess worked in eating recovery centers IOP program and became licensed in Texas in 2021.</p>
                <p>In 2023, Jess made the decision to move to be closer to her stepmother and father, who she is very close to. She is very excited to be able to work in person in the city of Coppell serving DFW residents. When she is not being a therapist, Jess is the mom to the most incredible child. And when she's not doing that, she can be found either with her family, working out, practicing yoga, or being out in nature, or in her studio.</p>
